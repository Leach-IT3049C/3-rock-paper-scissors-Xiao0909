how many points out of 20 do you deserve on this assignment: 17

## Self-Reflection:
I don't feel good with this assignment, because i can't make the game go successfully. I did everything i think I could do, but the button of the input name was still not working. I tried hard to fix that and I am not sure why this is still wrong

### How long it took me to finish this?
It took me about 7 hours to set up everything, then about two days to fix the button. I tried several times but it seems like failed again.
